# Bug fixing
'''
In this exercise, there will be several programs that don't work as they should after running or they even don't start at all..  
Your task is to run the program, find the bug and fix it :smiley:  
Read carefully information from the console about errors in the program.  
By working through these examples, you should get better at:  
  - reading errors
  - debugging
  - reading and editing other people's code
  - Googling for specific issues
  - solving errors on your own
